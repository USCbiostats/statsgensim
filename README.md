# statsgensim

This project is the starting kick for building a general framework for simulating complex disease and related simulation studies events in statistical genetics.

From an opinionated point of view, this project should be implemented as a C++ header-only library, with wrappers for other programming languages including R and Python.

The current name of the project is a WIP.

## Papers with neat simulation studies

Please list here any paper or scientific report that includes a simulation study that you believe we should consider for building this tool.
